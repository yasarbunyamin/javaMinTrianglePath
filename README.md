# javaMinTrianglePath
find minimum triangle path algorithm


Firstly, I get input from user line by line. If the user enters an entry other than integer, then the triangle is created with the integer values entered so far.
The string list in this list is converted to integer list and sent to the  "MinTrianglePath" method to find sum of mininum path.


Secondly, I copied the last line as a list-Array "(MinTrianglePath)". Because I used it to add the other elements of list from bottom to up.
